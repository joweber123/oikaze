        <h2 class="section-space">In a nutshell</h2>
        <p>Okinawa is Japan’s collection of paradise islands.  Not one but rather a collection of 160 islands, Okinawa is where Japanese people go to forget about it all, be on a beach and take in the sun.  Okinawa really is spectacular.  Okinawa island is the main island and where the majority of the population lives.  It is easily accessible by airplane and is the gateway to this beautiful part of the world.  Okinawa island is striking in its own right but the real magic though takes place on the other 159 Okinawan islands.  Staying at a near perfect 20°C/68°F year round Okinawa is the perfect place to hop from delightful island to island.  Most islands are quite small but offer some of the world’s best beaches, snorkeling and coral.  Okinawa only became officially part of Japan relatively recently and still holds tightly to its own culture and identity.  If a more casual bicycle tour with lots of stops on the beach and taking the occasional detour is snorkel is your thing, this might be the tour for you.

            <p><span class="blue">May </span> is quite rainy and is best to avoid if possible</p>
            <p><span class="green">June, July, August</span> is when Okinawa really comes into its peak and takes on that resort island feel.  Long biking days and beautiful beaches.</p>
            <p><span class="blue">September</span> Typhoon season in Okinawa and best to avoid.</p>
            <p><span class="green">October, November, December</span> Although Okinawa isn't known for its vibrant fall colors, the fall is a really great time for island hopping.  Less tourists on the road and more unspoiled views. </p>

              <p>Although our journey was considerably under-toweled, we were rank with an abundance of mountain vistas, waterfalls bleeding from within the rocky cliff faces, roadside Japanese mountain goats, and mountain valley lined with Cherry trees bursting forth their pink and white blossoms like gum under a desk.  Even with these beautiful distractions, the toll that these rough roads put on our bodies and bikes was worthy of a long soak in the geothermic waters of our hotel’s onsen.  </p>

              <p>The next day’s forecast called for rain all day long, so, ironically, we rolled early out into the sunshine.  It became immediately clear that our choice to cut the previous day short was brilliant.  Not only had it been raining, but a ride through the night would have kept this gorgeous scenery in the dark and out of view.  The lake, albeit damned, was gorgeous.  Surrounded by mountains on all sides, the road spooned, bent, and humped around the long lake’s many bays and points.  Connecting us along the way were a few red suspension bridges that helped keep things interesting. </p>

              <p> Around the bend we came to a road-side oasis with a fully stoked wood-burning oven, and fully tossed pizza dough.  Ten minutes and 500¥ ($5) later we were sitting under a cherry tree eating fresh delicious pizza. Yup.  That nice.  Eventually we forced ourselves back to the the road again after the complimentary hot tea, a quick chat, and that quick yet deeply connective mutual admiration of one another’s existence: their crafting one of a kind pizzas daily, and the chasing of horizons freedom on a bicycle.  The Japanese also say, “the grass is always greener on the other side.”  “Tonari no miwa no hou ga midori”**********</p>

              <p>Eventually the lake gave way to the big Yoshino river that feeds into the lake, and we climbed the accompanying road upstream.  The rivers in okinawa are famous for their beautiful turquoise water and for good reason.  The shallow rocky beds are like flowing jade stones, and the deeper pools are like a shot of wheatgrass in color, but without the bitter aftertaste. </p>

              <p> Following the mountain’s folds and creases, the river passed beneath and beside us from the left and opening up to the scores of waterfalls on the valley walls to the right.  Each one had its own personality; some were pouring great streams from high above, while others were content to leak slowly from the pores of the wet rock.  Roads in Japan are built with these in mind and they are directed below the roads to their eventual integration with the river below.  </p>

              <p>This would be our last big climb on this trip and the mountains mark the border between Kochi Prefecture to the south and Ehime Prefecture to the north.  Having ridden enough for a break, we did just that.  We hopped off the bike for some stretching and fueling our legs with salts and sweets.  Although we had the impression that we were alone on this un-trafficked mountain road, our presence was noticed quickly and before we knew it we were offered some freshly picked Dekopon (grapefruit size orange-like sweetness) with a woman named Misa. </p>

            <p> Misa is a Lumberjack who lives with her husband in this mountain paradise, far away from her big-city upbringing in Osaka.  Misa’s choice to leave the city in favor of the “Inaka” (countryside) is the opposite of most young people here in Japan who leave their quiet homes in favor of the excitement of the city.  Thanks to her trend-bucking decisions, we found ourselves sharing our time and space with a gentle spirit.  Misa, being so kind and inquisitive, stopped whatever she was doing when she looked out her window, and ran across the street with her Dekopon in hand as an offering.  She shared her story, and we shared ours… and some chocolate.  </p>
