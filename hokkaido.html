          <h2 class="section-space">In a nutshell</h2>
          <p>Hokkaido is Japan’s “Wild West” and is different from the rest of the country in many ways. The roads are wide and straight, the wheat fields stretch into the distance, and the homes have real insulation because of its cold winters. Hokkaido debunks the notion that all of Japan is packed and crowded; only 5% of the population lives here, on nearly 25% of the country. Yes indeed, Hokkaido is big and open. Blankets of snow in winter create a skier’s paradise, while the cool summers give us a place to ride throughout the summer months, which are hot and humid elsewhere in the country. Hokkaido enjoys six National Parks, and among them are rugged coastlines, marshes, volcanoes, caldera lakes, bears, rivers, mountains, and yes, hot springs. Every mile of road feels different from the rest of Japan due to the sheer mass and scale of the landscape. If you are looking to get away from it all, Hokkaido will remind you of our delicate fragility on this beautiful planet. Don’t miss out on the city life though. Sapporo is not only home to the beer that shares its namesake, but also some of the best ramen shops in the world and an annual snow festival visited by millions of people. Being an island in surrounded by frigid seas, it’s also famous for sushi. Are you hungry yet?

            <p><span class="grey">December, January, February</span> is pretty cold and wet in Shikoku and not the most ideal time for cycling.  We would recommend stearing clear of January and February in this part of the country if you are looking to be outside a lot.  </p>
            <p><span class="green">March, </span><span class="pink">April, </span><span class="green">May</span> is a great time in this part of the country and a splendid time to come. You will get some cherry blossoms if visiting in April, but just about every week there is something new blooming in this part of the country.</p>
            <p><span class="blue">June</span> is when the rainy season starts and you are best to avoid cycling in a typhoon if at all possible.</p>
            <p><span class="yellow">July, August</span> is really really hot and humid and we wouldn't recommend getting on a bicycle for any amount of time during the day during this time of the year.</p>
            <p><span class="red">September, October, November</span> is one of the most beautiful times to come to Shikoku.  The leaves are changing bright red, orange and yellow and the scenery really comes alive.</p>

        <h2 class="white">Story from the road</h2>
      </div>
      <p>James and I took a plane, a train, and a bus to the northern most island of Japan.  The kanji for Hokkaido literally means 北 North  海 sea  道 road.  The name alone makes you wanna go and explore its cold, bear-infested, wide open roads on bicycle.</p>
      <p>We ate lunch on the bank of a rock-bed river under blue skies, but that would soon change, and James and I wound up riding through pouring rain on the 4th day of our cycling trek through Hokkaido in nothing but sandals and bike shorts.  Slowly spinning our way up the mountain we earned a few eye popping looks from cautious drivers coming down, and my only regret is not being there when they told the story to their families about the crazy Gaijin.</p>
      <p>After a quick cup of hot coffee under a half-covered bridge, we dressed appropriately for the fast and cold descent into Kamikawa, our destination for the night, and let gravity pull us down.  We streaked (not literally) away from the mountain and the cold rain and into a quiet town, which was just closing down for the night.  We managed to stock up on bread and some savory baked goods minutes before they closed for the night, but we wouldn’t be so lucky at the Onsen (hot spring).</p>
      <p>Desperately in need of a deep cleaning we remembered what it is like to ride in a country where public baths aren’t around every corner, and we shuffled into the 7/11 restroom with a pocket full of baby-wipes like many bicycle tourists before us.</p>
      <p>On our way out we met the cutest five-year-old girl in the world, and her equally cute and charming mother.  We did our best to answer all the questions that the little girl had for us, and she was patient enough with ours.  After a good ten minutes, we parted ways only to see them again at the beer festival down the street.</p>
      <p>We had just parked our bikes against a building at the one block party, when we began to feel the welcoming party descend on us.  What ensued was much great conversation, funny-moments, and free beer and food lavished upon us by the townsfolk.</p>
      <p>The most talkative and generous of the bunch was a man who worked at a community garden project up the mountain.  As we would find out the next morning, this was no ordinary garden, but more on that later!  He introduced us to the full-time gardeners who just so happened to be the three cute girls sitting next to us.  We decided, or rather they decided it would be better to continue the party at the karaoke bar next door.</p>
      <p>At some point between a John Legend tune, and a rompin’ “Twist and Shout,” someone suggested that we set up camp on the front lawn of the train station.  This seemed a bit strange at first, but the man keeping our drinks full was very convincing, and we didn’t argue…nor did we have a better idea, so we made our gracious exit with plans for a morning pick up from the train station.</p>
      <p>The train station had a small lawn with a few park benches and some scattered trees, and there was one obvious spot, which was a mixed blessing; it was easy to find, but also easy to be seen by anyone who didn’t want vagrants camped out in town.  In hopes of scouting out a less conspicuous spot James went left and I went right.  Unfortunately for James, there was a three foot drop off in  the middle of the darkened path.  After realizing what happened, he picked himself up, reattached his bike bags, and questioned, with some well-earned profanity, the decision to end a sidewalk with a cliff.  We ended our search after this near-disaster, and went back to pass out on the train station’s front lawn.</p>
      <p>Unbroken and unfettered, we awoke early to a slight headache and James to his bruises.  Our man came early to pick us up and drive us to the mountaintop garden project.</p>
      <p>This little town, on a sparsely populated island has decided to pour, its heart (and its purse) into an amazing project.  The word garden doesn’t do it justice, so maybe Flower Learning, Observation, Research, and Appreciation center is better (The FLORA Center). </p>
      <p>They are still under construction, but they’re already growing more than 500 varieties of flowers throughout the meandering garden plots.</p>
      <p>We certainly appreciated our free guided tour of the work-in-progress, and spending time with these four friendly faces.</p>
      <p>Further up the mountain is the ultra-modern, organic, farm-to-table, make-sure-someone-else-pays restaurant and bar.  They were closed, and so were our wallets.</p>
      <p>We ended with an overcast view of Mt. Daisestuzan, the highest peak in Hokkaido, from the observation deck (the obscured view perhaps just a fly in the saddle-ointment).</p>
      <p>We headed down to buy our hosts some ice cream from the cafe, said our good-byes, James and I mounted our steel wheels, and screamed down the mountain.  It sure is comforting to know that you have friendly souls look after you when on the road, and it is even better if they bring you to the top of a mountain, and let gravity do the rest!     </p>

              <p>Although our journey was considerably under-toweled, we were rank with an abundance of mountain vistas, waterfalls bleeding from within the rocky cliff faces, roadside Japanese mountain goats, and mountain valley lined with Cherry trees bursting forth their pink and white blossoms like gum under a desk.  Even with these beautiful distractions, the toll that these rough roads put on our bodies and bikes was worthy of a long soak in the geothermic waters of our hotel’s onsen.  </p>

              <p>The next day’s forecast called for rain all day long, so, ironically, we rolled early out into the sunshine.  It became immediately clear that our choice to cut the previous day short was brilliant.  Not only had it been raining, but a ride through the night would have kept this gorgeous scenery in the dark and out of view.  The lake, albeit damned, was gorgeous.  Surrounded by mountains on all sides, the road spooned, bent, and humped around the long lake’s many bays and points.  Connecting us along the way were a few red suspension bridges that helped keep things interesting. </p>

              <p> Around the bend we came to a road-side oasis with a fully stoked wood-burning oven, and fully tossed pizza dough.  Ten minutes and 500¥ ($5) later we were sitting under a cherry tree eating fresh delicious pizza. Yup.  That nice.  Eventually we forced ourselves back to the the road again after the complimentary hot tea, a quick chat, and that quick yet deeply connective mutual admiration of one another’s existence: their crafting one of a kind pizzas daily, and the chasing of horizons freedom on a bicycle.  The Japanese also say, “the grass is always greener on the other side.”  “Tonari no miwa no hou ga midori”**********</p>

              <p>Eventually the lake gave way to the big Yoshino river that feeds into the lake, and we climbed the accompanying road upstream.  The rivers in Shikoku are famous for their beautiful turquoise water and for good reason.  The shallow rocky beds are like flowing jade stones, and the deeper pools are like a shot of wheatgrass in color, but without the bitter aftertaste. </p>
              <p><i>-“Pizza so good it can’t be enjoyed with a photo” is their slogan, so enjoy this mossy “welcome” sign instead!-</i></p>

              <p> Following the mountain’s folds and creases, the river passed beneath and beside us from the left and opening up to the scores of waterfalls on the valley walls to the right.  Each one had its own personality; some were pouring great streams from high above, while others were content to leak slowly from the pores of the wet rock.  Roads in Japan are built with these in mind and they are directed below the roads to their eventual integration with the river below.  </p>

              <p>This would be our last big climb on this trip and the mountains mark the border between Kochi Prefecture to the south and Ehime Prefecture to the north.  Having ridden enough for a break, we did just that.  We hopped off the bike for some stretching and fueling our legs with salts and sweets.  Although we had the impression that we were alone on this un-trafficked mountain road, our presence was noticed quickly and before we knew it we were offered some freshly picked Dekopon (grapefruit size orange-like sweetness) with a woman named Misa. </p>
