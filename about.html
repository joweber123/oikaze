        <h2>Oikaze Bicycle Tours</h2>
        <p>Oikaze Bicycle Tours is at the beginning a journey and vision of providing the top-quality travel experiences in Japan. We have spent the past five years touring the country, studying maps and discovering hidden gems on back roads. Our team has extensive travel experience around the globe, but we are drawn over and over again to Japan’s expansive natural beauty and deep local culture. We now want to share what we have learned with others and continue to grow ourselves as both cyclists and guides. We strive to provide our clients with one-of-a-kind travel experiences, connecting with local culture and visiting the best that Japan has to offer. We put in the extra effort both before and during your travel to ensure you are on the pristine roads at the best possible times.</p>

            <p class="half-half-description">Ben grew up in Milwaukee and lived in the same house for his first 18 years. The next 18 would be quite the opposite. Moving across the country several times and rarely for more than a year at a time, Ben has kept an open mind and an open eye on what and where to next. From cultural epicenters like San Francisco and New Orleans to the wild canyons of Idaho and mountains of Montana, Ben has jumped at every opportunity for the next adventure. For nearly 10 years he led troubled teens through wilderness-therapy expeditions, so he learned to manage difficult and stressful expeditions with positive communication and safety as his compass.  Although he had little exposure to anything Japanese before, he took the chance to make a longer term commitment and moved to Japan in 2012. After three years of exploring Japan by bicycle, he found someone to share new adventures with, including a six month bicycle adventure in South America. Now he is looking to share the adventure and his passion for cycling and discovery with others.</p>

            <p class="half-half-description">Ten years ago, James left Wisconsin and began his long, winding journey around the world, living mostly in South America and Europe. Always open for adventure and a new challenge, he landed in Japan in 2012, envisioning a one-year stay before hitting the road again. As fate would have it, he fell in love both with his future wife and with all that Japan has to offer. He has spent the last five years in Japan, planning bicycle trips and learning all this amazing country has to offer. When he’s not on his bicycle, he is sewing his own handmade bicycle bags, studying Japanese and working as a web developer.  </p>
