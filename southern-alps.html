          <h2 class="section-space">In a nutshell</h2>
          <p>Japan is a country of mountains.  It is hard to be anywhere in Japan without at least one mountain rising in the distance.  The Alps of Japan stand out from all other though in both quantity and sheer size.  Almost all of Japan’s highest peaks are in this region with Fuji-san herself keeping watch just to the east.  Sprinkled between these immense peaks are some of Japan’s best cultural experiences.  Nagano is home to many of these must sees such as  Jigokudani monkey park with the neighboring Shikga-kogen hot spring village. Nagano is also home to zenkoji temple, one of the most important temples in Japan, housing the first Buddhist statue to come to Japan.  Into the mountains, the stunning roads are mostly free from any type of traffic and provide the most spectacular views  of deep Japanese scenery.  Barreling down into the Japanese wine growing region of Yamanashi to do some local wine tasting is an exception way to end a hard day of cycling in the mountains.  Fuji stands alone with five lakes offering the best views of the giant.  This is one of the most famous regions for growing Japanese tea and roads are often cut directly through the tea plantations.  Down into the Izu peninsula you are rewarded with almost unused ocean roads abundant hot springs.  This has long been a quick getaway for people living in the nearby metropolis areas for good reason.

            <p><span class="grey">December, January, February</span> is pretty cold and wet in southern-alps and not the most ideal time for cycling.  We would recommend stearing clear of January and February in this part of the country if you are looking to be outside a lot.  </p>
            <p><span class="green">March, </span><span class="pink">April, </span><span class="green">May</span> is a great time in this part of the country and a splendid time to come. You will get some cherry blossoms if visiting in April, but just about every week there is something new blooming in this part of the country.</p>
            <p><span class="blue">June</span> is when the rainy season starts and you are best to avoid cycling in a typhoon if at all possible.</p>
            <p><span class="yellow">July, August</span> is really really hot and humid and we wouldn't recommend getting on a bicycle for any amount of time during the day during this time of the year.</p>
            <p><span class="red">September, October, November</span> is one of the most beautiful times to come to southern-alps.  The leaves are changing bright red, orange and yellow and the scenery really comes alive.</p>

        <h2 class="white">Story from the road</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Our first night of our bike tour on the Izu Peninsula, was restless as the winds threatened to blow our tent into the bay.  We made the change to a Japanese ryokan hotel with onsen (hot spring) on our second night.    Leaving the tent on the bike was a great idea.  We slept on Tatami mats, wore Yukatta, and soaked in our own personal onsen in the cool ocean air breeze.</p>

      <p>A short hike, albeit straight uphill, out the Ryokan’s front door led to a rocky beach sunset.  The giant sea-stack that stood between us and the burning sunset has gone through a ten thousand-year renovation.  The sea-stack has a gaping hole in its center that extends down to the water, leaving a sunset themed Viewmaster in its wake.  The final exale of the day’s light, funneled through the massive rock and kaleidoscoped off the blue water, left a lasting mark on my emotional center.</p>
      <p>The next morning after our geothermic bath, we rolled up our futons, and gobbled up some miso soup before making an early get away.</p>
      <p>Before we could even hit the main road out of town, we were blinded by an imposing Fuji-san.  I don’t know if anyone could ever normalize the sight of Fuji over the bay, and I wonder about the productivity of the locals residing in sight of this overwhelming beauty.  Fuji would seem to be out of reach from our position so far south on the peninsula, but he stands tall lifting his snow capped dome into the heavens.</p>
      <p>Our early-bird start was rewarded with an immediate and steep climb away from the coast.  Our route had us leaving the main road (Although I hesitate to call any road with such little traffic such as this “the main road,”), and taking a left up a road that wound up being too steep to ride (photo omitted for over-active imagination purposes).  I admit we contemplated changing our route and continuing down the coast, but the lure of the mountains was too strong.  After pushing our bikes up the first 200 meters of the climb, the slope relented enough for us to pedal once again as we entered a pine forest and dotted with quaint mountain homes of inland Izu.</p>
      <p>Lets get to the good part, eh?  The descent was steep and seemed to never end.  Luckily, for our brake pads, it relented somewhat into a slopping valley that carried our momentum for what seemed like miles.  The valley road was sprinkled with a handful of farms and went along the banks of a spring-fed stream.  I gave the Japanese version of howdy to the two youngsters sitting on the side of the road, which seems like a universal countryside thing to do.</p>
      <p>As luck would have it, my next breath came through my nose, and the unmistakable perfume of bread sliding out of a hot oven slapped me across my face, and reminded my tummy that the furnace burning within always has room for fuel.  Especially when on a long ride.  Allow me to clarify that this is a sparsely populated valley without any shops and this evidence pointed toward a grim reality; these leavened loaves living in my nose were perhaps just a good idea without a happy ending.  Nevertheless, I investigated with a man further down the road.  Using all the Japanese I could muster, I asked him about the mysterious bread.  At first he confirmed my doubts, but my persistence, fact-checking, and citing my underdeveloped olfactory bulb, he remembered that the lady down the road bakes her bread at home and brings it to market.  We thanked him, and were quickly on our way.</p>
      <p>The two boys from earlier were now on the front porch of their home studying Kanji.  Their mother Hiroe, was surprised and delighted at our arrival.  She was pulling out a tray of hot bread as we inquired about the our recently solved mystery.</p>
      <p>Her English was good enough and our Japanese was bad enough to make friends while the next batch took their turn in the van-mounted traveling bakery.  Her husband, San-chan, gave us a tour of the garden out back where they grow half the wheat they use.  The other half comes from Hokkaido.</p>
      <p>Hiroe, San-chan, and their two boys moved from the “standing room only” lifestyle of Tokyo to a simple cottage under the shadow of these coastal mountains 8 years ago.  As luck would have it, they frequented a live house/ bar in Kunitachi, called Kakekome, where I have spent a few quality nights of sleep!  It’s a small world.</p>
      <p>As the last round rose, James and I made a pot of tea to share with our gracious hosts, much to their delight.  We bought what seemed to be a wasteful amount of the warm bread, biscuts, rolls, and buns, but it wouldn’t last even 50 kilometers before being scarfed down by our hungry heroes!  Chocolate banana, date walnut, and some buttery vegan (I’m aware!) rosemary rolls were shared much like how a male lion shares first bites with the hard working lionesses.  Unfortunately, bakeries like that aren’t on every corner. We thanked them graciously, and hit the road.</p>
      <p>Our next stop, on a day of many, was a farmer’s market that had a luxurious and piping hot foot bath.  Arizono-san joined us, and continued making the magic that makes Japan so special.</p>

              <p>Although our journey was considerably under-toweled, we were rank with an abundance of mountain vistas, waterfalls bleeding from within the rocky cliff faces, roadside Japanese mountain goats, and mountain valley lined with Cherry trees bursting forth their pink and white blossoms like gum under a desk.  Even with these beautiful distractions, the toll that these rough roads put on our bodies and bikes was worthy of a long soak in the geothermic waters of our hotel’s onsen.  </p>

              <p>The next day’s forecast called for rain all day long, so, ironically, we rolled early out into the sunshine.  It became immediately clear that our choice to cut the previous day short was brilliant.  Not only had it been raining, but a ride through the night would have kept this gorgeous scenery in the dark and out of view.  The lake, albeit damned, was gorgeous.  Surrounded by mountains on all sides, the road spooned, bent, and humped around the long lake’s many bays and points.  Connecting us along the way were a few red suspension bridges that helped keep things interesting. </p>

              <p> Around the bend we came to a road-side oasis with a fully stoked wood-burning oven, and fully tossed pizza dough.  Ten minutes and 500¥ ($5) later we were sitting under a cherry tree eating fresh delicious pizza. Yup.  That nice.  Eventually we forced ourselves back to the the road again after the complimentary hot tea, a quick chat, and that quick yet deeply connective mutual admiration of one another’s existence: their crafting one of a kind pizzas daily, and the chasing of horizons freedom on a bicycle.  The Japanese also say, “the grass is always greener on the other side.”  “Tonari no miwa no hou ga midori”**********</p>

              <p>Eventually the lake gave way to the big Yoshino river that feeds into the lake, and we climbed the accompanying road upstream.  The rivers in southern-alps are famous for their beautiful turquoise water and for good reason.  The shallow rocky beds are like flowing jade stones, and the deeper pools are like a shot of wheatgrass in color, but without the bitter aftertaste. </p>

              <p> Following the mountain’s folds and creases, the river passed beneath and beside us from the left and opening up to the scores of waterfalls on the valley walls to the right.  Each one had its own personality; some were pouring great streams from high above, while others were content to leak slowly from the pores of the wet rock.  Roads in Japan are built with these in mind and they are directed below the roads to their eventual integration with the river below.  </p>

              <p>This would be our last big climb on this trip and the mountains mark the border between Kochi Prefecture to the south and Ehime Prefecture to the north.  Having ridden enough for a break, we did just that.  We hopped off the bike for some stretching and fueling our legs with salts and sweets.  Although we had the impression that we were alone on this un-trafficked mountain road, our presence was noticed quickly and before we knew it we were offered some freshly picked Dekopon (grapefruit size orange-like sweetness) with a woman named Misa. </p>
