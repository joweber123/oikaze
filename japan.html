        <h2>Japan has captured our imagination</h2>
        <p>Since 2012, we’ve been cycling through Japan’s backroads, searching for the next cafe, the next temple, the next valley vista, and always always always the next mountain descent. We’ve put in the time, energy, and effort to become comfortable anywhere in Japan. There is a learning curve to successfully explore Japan by bicycle. Through years of wrong turns, bad translations, missed trains, broken spokes, closed roads, and rainy days, we’ve become comfortable in any situation while on our bicycles here in Japan. There is always a nervous excitement putting our bikes into rinko bags and getting them on the train. All the research and planning aside, the real adventure is always more than we expected. Every bend in the road gives us reason to pause and appreciate those moments we have while free and on the road.  The only hard part is not stopping every time the view begs for a photo. We have reservations at the Inn after all. Sure wouldn’t want to be late for dinner. Lets keep going. It gets even better up ahead…</p>

        <h2 class="white">Cyclists Paradise</h2>
        <p class="white">Japan is a cyclist’s paradise. Its unique combination of natural beauty and accessibility make it readily experienced. We are able to pack our bikes onto the clean and timely trains that seem to go everywhere. After a smooth train ride and a yummy bento-box lunch, we step out at spectacular starting points throughout the country. Roads are paved and well-maintained, regardless of how far off the beaten track it may be. Convex mirrors allow you to see around corners when descending mountain passes at high speed. And after all this, finding a hot spring to soak off sore and aching muscles is easily within reach.</p>

              <h3 class="white">Mountains</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="half-half-description">Japan is covered in mountains -- big and small. The lowland hills roll up like floating forests with old homes and gardens populating the gaps. There are rice fields and small-scale farms in every valley between. Further up into the mountains you’ll find life slows down, and the natural landscapes dominate our senses. This is where we will find fluffy pink and white cherry trees blossoming high up the valley walls in spring, and firey red, yellow, and orange maple leaves changing in the fall. Keep your eyes peeled for inushishi (wild boar) and the Kamoshika (Japanese mountain goat/ Serow). The wildlife is just as odd and fanciful as the most creative anime or manga.</p>

              <h3 class="white">Onsen</h3>

            </div>
            <p class="half-half-description">The culture and history of Japan are inextricably linked to the Onsen. The ultimate in luxury, Onsen have changed our lives through the art of bathing and will certainly be a central part of any tour with Oikaze. The active geothermal activity is the true heartbeat of Japan. This is where you will find the true nature and simplicity of Japan and its people. All it takes is a long relaxing soak, with mountains in the distance, and surrounded by naked strangers. You’ll have photos of temples, tastes of fresh sushi, and memories of the people you will meet, but the experience you’ll have while warm, naked, and comfortable among nature will be the feeling that will stay with you long after you return home.</p>

              <h3 class="white">Food</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="half-half-description">The Japanese are obsessed with food. Their pallette is expansive and embraces subtle flavors and food experiences. There are specialties in every region, prefecture, and town. It’s not a secret, and everyone will ask if you’ve had “____” yet.  Japanese sake, beer, meats and fish, locally sourced mountain vegetables, and especially Japanese rice, are held on the same pedestal. If you are a foodie, this will be your heaven. If you’re a picky eater, there’s plenty of fried chicken, hamburgers, fried street food and ice cream galore. You certainly won’t go hungry here no matter what your preferences. If you only know sushi, our tours will broaden your Japanese food vocabulary, and you’ll walk away dreaming of all your new favorites: udon, soba, okonomiyaki, yakitori, gyoza, nagasaki champon and much more. We love to engage with locals at small mom and pop run restaurants and strive to show you the best of what each region has to offer.  </p>

              <h3 class="white">Festivals</h3>

            </div>
            <p class="half-half-description">The Japanese calendar revolves around colorful, fanciful and sometimes downright bizarre festivals. If you are lucky enough, and we will try our hardest to make sure that you are, you’ll have the opportunity to dance, dress up, and participate in far flung community gatherings.  People get together to eat and drink under flowering cherry trees, to celebrate local harvests, Buddhist Gods, summer-time dancing, and just about anything else you could think of. It is a chance for the people to be unabashingly Japanese; wear kimonos, drink lots of beer, eat street food, light fireworks, and dance and sing the traditional songs. These are the places that people really let down their guard and go out of their way to talk with people and where you can really feel the generosity and curiosity of this beautiful country. Bring your cameras, an empty stomach, and an open mind. You’ll need all three to fully appreciate these events.   </p>

        <p class="white">Even for a seasoned traveler, Japan is fascinating. It is clean, safe and blends tradition, modernity, subtleness and in-your-face over the topness at every corner. We take the time to immerse you in this culture in a deep and meaningful fashion.</p>
